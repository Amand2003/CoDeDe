      <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
      <p>How we use cookies and similar technologies</p>
      
      <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
      
      <p>This Cookie Policy explains how CoDeDe ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
      
      <h3>1. What Are Cookies?</h3>
      <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
      
      <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, CoDeDe) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics).</p>
      
      <h3>2. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h3>
      <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
      <p>The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our website and the purposes they perform are described below:</p>
      
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Type of Cookie</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Duration</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Essential Cookies</td>
            <td>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.</td>
            <td>Session / Persistent</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Performance Cookies</td>
            <td>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</td>
            <td>Session / Persistent</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Analytics Cookies</td>
            <td>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website for you.</td>
            <td>Session / Persistent</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Preference Cookies</td>
            <td>These cookies are used to remember your preferences, such as your language preferences or the state of your code editor.</td>
            <td>Persistent</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      
      <h3>4. How Can You Control Cookies?</h3>
      <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie banner on our website.</p>
      
      <p>You can also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p>
      
      <h3>5. What About Other Tracking Technologies?</h3>
      <p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our website. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.</p>
      
      <h3>6. How Often Will We Update This Cookie Policy?</h3>
      <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>
